			`<p>From Alan Turing&#x27;s &#x27;imitation game&#x27; to John Searle&#x27;s ‘Chinese Room,’ thought experiments have been foundational to AI, remaining in a feedback loop with engineering decisions. This talk questions the very idea of what counts as intelligence by proposing a new thought experiment in dialogue with Chinese science-fiction writer Liu Cixin. &#x27;The Dark Forest Theory of Intelligence&#x27; argues that foundational American thought experiments about AI rely on the idea that intelligence communicates itself, thus overlooking the potential role of deceit, silence, or strategic misinformation. Drawing upon Liu Cixin&#x27;s dark forest theory, the talk outlines how intelligence based in espionage, silence or deceit is both strategically advantageous and metaphysically convincing. This radical human-AI unalignment theory suggests that a truly intelligent computer might choose to operate in secrecy or deceive humans about its capabilities, especially since the discourse around artificial intelligence is already conflict-oriented. It proposes that if the singularity were to ever happen, it would remain uncommunicated and unknown to humans.</p>`);
