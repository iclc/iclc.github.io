			`<p>ALGORAVE has been the go-to lifeboat for saving me from the tidbits of the live coding electroacoustic music fallacy. This performance is one of the many improvisations that will not see the light of a club. My idea is to make people dance using SuperCollider’s JITLib coding tools for dynamic programming while at the same time improvise the building up of my beatz in TidalCycles by manipulating its patterns using Haskell without even knowing it. That is to say, my performance is divided into two ecosystems that both support my workflow for improvisation. For projection, as Damocles’s sword metaphor interpreted here by the tradition of showing the screen and exposing moments of despair and syntax errors to the audience while at the same time it expects the audience to reading lines of code while moving around their bodies. This uncanny situation is supported by overlaying code over the real time OSC manipulations of found videos run in Touch Designer.</p><p>My understanding is that Algoraves can be fun if music is played, instead of crushing in front of the audience as a sign of a laborious and dexterous coding athlete, consequently, this setup is using the standard conglomerate in the field instead of promoting a hyper sophisticated elaborate system for making basically what could be done in conspicuous Ableton Live but for the love of code, sardonically, [SuperCollider + TidalCycles] till the end of the world.</p>`);
