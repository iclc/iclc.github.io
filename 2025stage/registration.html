				This year we have 3 tiers of registration for Contributors. You can find these in the ticketshop (Entradium) via the ICLC website at <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/2025/registration">https://iclc.toplap.org/2025/registration</a>. Please an important disclaimer about Entradium below.
				<br><br>
				- Tier 1 - Independent Contributor: Presenting contributors without institutional funding (Students, Independent Artists and Researchers): €96.90
				<br>
				- Tier 2 - Supported Contributor: Presenting contributors with institutional or other funding: €147.90
				<br>
				- Tier 3 - Supporting Contributor: Presenting contributors with institutional or other funding who can support at a level that will help to offset the costs of others: €295.80
				<br><br>
				Please note, if this reduced-rate attendence still presents a financial hardship, you may contact us at iclc@toplap.cat to request to volunteer in exchange for a discount. 
				<br><br>
				
				As in previous ICLCs, the tier you select depends on the honor system. Your choice to contribute as much as you can (or what your Institution/University can) helps to make sure ICLC remains as open and accessible as possible. Because ICLC 2025 itself is not institutionally funded, our fees are necessarily

				All passes include full access to all conference events, concerts, and workshops. (Note, you will still have to RSVP for individual workshops!) We will open up the workshop sign up later in March.`);
				
				paragraph('about', 'Registration Deadline', `
				In order to help us anticipate headcounts and track attendance, please make sure you are registered by May 1, 2025 if at all possible. We will allow late registrations in case you have a delay, but having reliable numbers as early as possible will help us make good procurement decisions.`);
				
				paragraph('about', '', `General Attendance passes (for those who are not presenting) will be made available separately on the ICLC website.`);

				paragraph('about', 'More info about Entradium and our payment partners', `For registrations and tickets, we are using a platform called Entradium. When you link to the tickets above, you will leave our website and land on Entradium. You will see the tickets presented by Axolot Collective, one of ICLC 2025's organizing partners. At checkout you will see the payment itself is being processed by Crocantickets SL.
				<br><br>
				Please note that the Entradium platform including the checkout page are not hosted by ICLC and we do not endorse their additional donation suggestion, the related charity, nor the Newsletter opt-in.`);
