		paragraphMapRight('p1', 'Getting to Barcelona', `By train: To minimize your environmental impact, we recommend train travel whenever possible. Barcelona is connected by high-speed rail to the rest of Spain and France, with connections through Paris, Lyon and Perpignan. The city's main station is Barcelona-Sants.
			We recommend using RailEurope.com or theTrainline.com to plan international train and bus trips, as well as long to medium distance travel in Spain. 
			<br><a href = "https://www.barcelonaturisme.com/wv3/en/page/31/how-to-get-there.html" > More options to arrive </a></p>
			<br><h4>Getting Around During the Conference</h4> <br>Most of the Conference venues are located in the Poblenou district, within a walking distance of about 20 minutes. Please consult the map for various locations.`);

		`
		
				<br>
		Train (RENFE):
		R2 Nord from airport Terminal 2B runs every half hour and reaches the city center (2,65€ one-way). The 5th stop, Barcelona-El Clot, is walking distance to UOC.
		<br>
		Metro (TMB):
		L9 Sud metro line connects the city directly to airport Terminals 1 and 2, with an extra ticket required at the airport stations, and a change to metro line L1 required at Torrassa station. It takes approx one hour to Catalunya metro station. For a one-way ticket, it costs 5,70€.
		<br>
		Bus:
		Line 46 (Outside the T1 airport station - 2,65€ approx). <a href = https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona/buses/-/lineabus/46> Bus 46</a> takes about 45 minutes and connects to the Espanya Metro Station.
		<br>
		Aerobús (A1 and A2)
		Connects to Plaça Catalunya in about 35 min. It needs an extra ticket, currently costing 7,45€ one-way or 12,85€ round-trip.

		paragraphImageRight('p1', 'Public Transport', `
		Public transport such as the metro, tram and FGC trains are the quickest, simplest, most convenient and most sustainable way of getting around Barcelona. 
		You can choose from the different ticket types and travel cards, but if you expect to use public transport a few times throughout the conference, the most economical would be a T-casual card, which comes with ten fares for 12,55 € (plus the cost of the rechargeable card, which costs 1 € to obtain).
		https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona-fares-metro-bus  <br><br>
		To purchase the tickets, we suggest using a ticket machine in any metro station and buying the reusable/rechargeable paper ticket. 

		You can pay for public transport in 2 different ways:
		<br>	
		- By using your contactless debit card, credit card, or phone to purchase a single ride for 2,65 €. On the bus or tram you just tap to pay at the front door, and in the Metro, use a ticket machine to purchase the single ticket.
		<br>
		- (Preferred) By using an anonymous rechargeable ticket, called T-casual. You only need to buy for one zone, which covers the city of Barcelona and to the airport via RENFE regional train.

		paragraphImageLeft('p1', 'Visiting', `
		Barcelona, like many other cities, is subject to over-tourism and intense gentrification. However, it remains home to our TOPLAP Barcelona community, which actively contributes to preserving the city's dynamic underground cultural scene. Barcelona warmly welcomes the global TOPLAP community and all ICLC participants. 
<br>
		Our desire is for the live coding community to be part of the solution of overtourism through our creative and cultural initiative, ensuring that ICLC genuinely contributes to Barcelona and its people in a meaningful and positive way, embracing everyone with kindness and inclusivity. We invite you to experience our city mindfully and considerately.

		<br><br>

		Staying Safe
Barcelona is no more or less safe than any other major metropolis. When visiting and exploring a new place, being mindful and respectful of your surroundings is essential. Beyond ensuring our own safety, we should be mindful and contribute positively to the well-being of those who call the city home.

		paragraphImageRight('p1', 'Food & Drinks', `
		Barcelona has every cuisine you would expect to find in a multicultural city, as well as ubiquitous tapas bars at all price points.

A typical breakfast option is a bakery or café for coffee and pastries, and sometimes light sandwich options. The 3-course lunch "menu del dia" is typically served between 12:30/13:00 until around 15:30 at the latest, primarily at neighborhood bars and restaurants. For dinner many restaurants will open the kitchen around 20h, but it is usually possible to find options at all times.<br>

		paragraphImageLeft('p1', 'Meals during ICLC', `
		During the ICLC weekday program at UOC,  we will offer a catered lunch to those who pre-purchase vouchers from the Registration portal. In case an off-campus break is preferred, there are a few nearby spots, of which we would most recommend the food court in the Glòries shopping complex 1 block to the west of UOC, for reasons of capacity and efficiency. In the courtyard and lower level there are many fast and healthy options.
		<br>
		It is a time-honored tradition in Barcelona to enjoy late-night tapas, pinchos, or bocadillos together after an evening show. We generally expect there to be lots of options open after our concerts on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Keep an eye on the curated map, where we may list some of our favorite spots.

		`, `assets/img/2025-meals.jpg`);
		
		paragraphImageRight('p1', 'Accommodation',`
The city of Barcelona has thousands of hotels and hostels in various price ranges. We have listed a handful of nearby accommodations in different price categories in our map above. We do not have purchasing or discount deals with any of them - we simply researched and identified several from each price bracket (2, 3, or 4 stars) which seemed to offer straightforward transportation and had decent reviews. Their icons are coded such that each is marked as walking distance to UOC, biking distance, tram or metro connection. 		<br><br>
