        paragraph('faq-1', 'Will the submission deadline be extended this year?',
        `Because we want to publish the invitations as soon as possible, so that there is time to make sensible travel arrangements, we will not be extending the submission deadline beyond the original cutoff date of December 15th. However! We still want to give a little bit of wiggle room, so:
        <ul>
            <li>All submissions <strong>registered</strong> by the end of the 15th of December (before 00:00 GMT on 16th) can be <strong>edited</strong> until the end of the 18th of December so that final touches can be added or updated. This means you must create the entry and receive a Submission ID via email, so that you can log back in later and make your updates, until the 18th. <strong>The system will stop assigning Submission IDs at 00:00 GMT on Dec. 16th.</strong></li>
            <li>An additional reminder: proposals for <strong>long-form videos and community report videos</strong> only require a 5 minute teaser, so the full video can be finished until camera-ready deadlines.</li>
            <li>Another reminder: Because we intend that all community reports will be published in the proceedings, regardless of peer review, these submissions may be accepted late, but <strong>only community report papers received by the submission deadline will be peer reviewed for possible presentation at the Conference</strong>. Later submissions will only be in the proceedings. Later community report videos can still be included in the digital gallery.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        `);

        paragraph('faq-2', 'Is the community report a paper OR a video, or can it also be a paper AND a video?',
		`Any combination is allowed.
        <br><br>
        `);

        paragraph('faq-3', 'Does the paper or video for community reports have to be finished before the submission deadline or can it be finished later for the camera ready deadline?',
		`Because we intend that all community reports will be published in the proceedings, regardless of peer review, these submissions may be accepted late, but <strong>only community report papers received by the submission deadline will be peer reviewed for possible presentation at the Conference</strong>. Later submissions will only be in the proceedings. Later community report videos can still be included in the digital gallery.

        `);

        paragraph('faq-4', 'Are Satellite events meant to take place at the same time as the conference and as a substitute for it, or adjacent events before and after the conference?',
		`We envision Satellite Events as a potential to both engage local communities where travel to Utrecht is highly impractical, and as a scheme to create additional dates around Europe that would foster a touring opportunity for artists who are coming a long way to ICLC, to get the most out of their travel. So, we encourage any kind of event, but if in Europe, we hope you'll choose dates that are well-coordinated with other Satellite Events to join in creating a sort of <strong>itinerary</strong> that is accessible to as many artists as possible, rather than coinciding with other events or the conference itself. Please check out <strong>#iclc-satellite-events</strong> on the <a href="https://t.co/67hP3XJkuU">TOPLAP Discord</a> to join the conversation.
