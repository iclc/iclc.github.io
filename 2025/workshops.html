			'VOGELFREI',
			`Are you the person at the Algorave asking for the HDMI cable? (Do you secretly have a 10m one in your bag already?) Are you sick of everyone talking about sounds when you want to be talking about throwing shapes? Meet up with other visualists and share your questions, suggestions, works, and make new friends. Maybe commiserate a little. This workshop will be led by four visualists and tool-makers — Antonio Roberts, Guy John, Olivia Jack, and Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo — but its format will be determined by the needs of the attendees. It might take the form of an open projector, informal group discussion, breakout groups, or some other improvisation.`,
			`Participants can bring a laptop if they want to showcase their own work. This workshop is suitable for beginners.`,
			`<strong>Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo</strong> is the visualist for Codie, a live-code collective that originated in NYC, but has spread around the world. <strong>Olivia Jack</strong> is a programmer and artist who works frequently with open-source software, cartography, live coding, and experimental interfaces. <strong>Guy John</strong> is an engineer with an interest in programming language design, who enjoys building and performing with visual live coding environments. <strong>Antonio Roberts</strong> is an artist and curator based in Birmingham, UK, working primarily with video, code, and sound.`

			'VOGELFREI',
			`In this workshop, you will experience how coding can be used in musical, performative and literary arts by using tools such as live coding, Youtube, Hydra, Inverse.website and Sonic Pi to name a few. You will learn how to use network elements to your advantage when writing or producing work, and how to take inspiration from your everyday life to provide data to your code, by adding data visualization and sonification to the mix. This allows us to not only be able to express ourselves, but to create a little universe of our choosing. This framework has been used to make works of horror, sci-fi and fantasy type works and adjacent.`,

			'Roger Pibernat, Glen Fraser',
			'April 20th, 15:15 &ndash; 17:15',
			'VOGELFREI',
			`Animatron is an experimental environment (very much a “work in progress”) that enables creation of “visual poetry” in the form of animations and images, created in real-time through live coding. It's implemented using the open-source Godot engine, and communicates with any “client” application or live coding language — such as SuperCollider — via the network, using the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol and MIDI.`,
			`Participants need to bring their laptop to the workshop, and their MIDI controllers (optional). This workshop is suitable for all levels. No prior experience or software installation is required, although proficiency in any live coding language that supports OSC is welcome.`,

			`Lilypond is a language for sheet music engraving: during this workshop, participants will learn the basics and how they can use that in a live context. With LiveLily, a Live Sequencing and Live Scoring software, the user can create music scores in real time, and a sequencer based on these scores. The LiveLily sequencer can be as expressive as a Western notation music score can, capable of transferring dynamics, articulation and arbitrary information to the instruments it controls. Being a hybrid system, combining Live Scoring and Live Sequencing, LiveLily can be used for both Live Scoring with acoustic instruments, and Live Sequencing electronic music, or even a combination of these two.`,
			`This workshop is focused on sheet music creation, so the participants are expected to know how to read Western notation sheet music. A laptop is required, participants are encouraged to have some audio software that supports OSC installed, as the software of the workshop does not produce sound. Acoustic instruments are not mandatory, but it participants are encouraged to bring an instrument so they can sight-read scores created during the workshop.`,
			`<strong>Alexandros Drymonitis</strong> is a sound and new media artist who focuses on new media techniques such as computer programming and AI, or older practices, like modular synthesis.`

			'VOGELFREI',
			`On top of all of the chaos that goes into organizing a show, the logistics involved in documenting it can feel like an expendable effort. However, having good documentation means the performers have quality assets for their portfolios. It means we have promotion assets for the next shows. It means we can apply for grants for future shows. It means we can tell the story for future audiences. Documentation is a life-long practice that can breathe new life into the work when it is treated like a craft more than an afterthought. The workshop is a theoretical and practical session on the craft of documenting art, specifically through the lens of live-code performances.`,

			'VOGELFREI',
			`Using Nodysseus, a node-editor for browser, we'll explore creating and using reusable node networks with 3D objects. This is a hands-on tutorial, quite literally: participants can use their touch device of choice or their laptops. By the end of the workshop, participants will be more comfortable thinking in node networks and have a spiffy live(low)code party trick they can revisit at any time.`,
			`Nodysseus and the exercises in the workshop don't require prior coding knowledge, but participants with some familiarity with coding structures or some experience with node-based editors will gain the most out of the class. Participation during the workshop can be on a phone, tablet, or laptop.`,

			'Alejandro Sánchez Medina',
			'April 21st, 15:30 &ndash; 17:30',
			'Nijverheid: Kadeboot',
			`A common pattern around live-coding software is that it tends to be hard to install for the average user. However, as a community we would greatly benefit from lowering the barrier of entrance to more complex stacks for a wider and more inclusive reach. A tool that can help nudging the live-coding ecosystem towards this goal is the package manager Nix. This workshop will provide a guided introduction to Nix (<a href="https://nixos.org">https://nixos.org/</a>), a functional package manager for declarative configuration of general software dependencies.`,
			`No previous Nix experience is required to participate in this workshop. Bring your personal laptop to work during the practical part of the workshop. Windows users are encouraged to come with a Linux Virtual Machine. Nix can work from within the Windows Subsystem for Linux, albeit with some limitations compared to native Nix systems. It is highly recommended that participants come with their own project to package, or a project they already want to use but could not manage to make it work in a specific setup.`,
			`<strong>Alejandro Sánchez Medina</strong> is a software developer, live-coder and independent researcher working with machine learning, artificial intelligence, privacy preserving machine learning, future-proof technology, reproducible systems and FLOSS software and hardware.`

			`Scorch is a new domain-specific music programming language designed by Norah Lorway, Edward Powley and Arthur Wilson with the intention of being an accessible entry point for those not experienced in traditional programming languages. Initially used for algorithmic composition as a MIDI generating VST plugin, Scorch is also being used for live coding and a variety of media computing applications. Scorch incorporates various AI implementations meant to assist users with various musical and computing tasks. Amongst these include an AI collaborator called Autopia, which was designed to explore the three-way interaction between AI, human performer and audience — the AI uses an evolutionary algorithm seeded with human-written code and guided by live audience feedback.`,
			`The workshop is accessible for beginners. Participants need their own laptop and a copy of Reaper, or the participant's preferred DAW software.`,

			'Iván Abreu, Malitzin Cortés (CNDSD)',
			'April 22nd, 12:00 &ndash; 15:45',
			'HKU IBB-Laan',
			`We define Live Cinema Coding as a performative practice (heir to Live cinema) that uses live coding to sequence cinematographic shots, transform a 3D scene, animate actors, control light, process videos, etc. We use the pattern strength of Tidal to create sound-visual synesthesia and sound visualization by refactoring musical patterns into visual patterns. The objective of the workshop is to show the authors' workflow, both conceptual and technical: the choice of "what" patterns to refactor and "how" from listening to our own musical composition. Or the process of abstracting into custom haskell functions within Tidal Cycles and converting them to OSC addresses for redirection and flexible visual consequence in Processing, Unreal Engine or DMX stage lighting.`,
			`The workshop requires some experience using Tidal Cycles. It is necessary to have <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/">Tidal Cycles</a> (SuperCollider), <a href="https://processing.org/download">Processing</a> and <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download">Unreal Engine</a> already installed prior to the workshop.`,
			`<strong>Malitzin Cortés (CNDSD)</strong> is an artist who investigates the forms in which sound, architecture, technology and science hold the ability to be great diffusers of discoveries and devices of self-reflection that can unleash speculative worlds. <strong>Iván Abreu</strong> explores the veracity and instrumental capacity of science and technology in art contexts, and the poetic and/or political value of the findings that emerge from these intersections.`
