					<h1 class="mt-5 mb-4">Safety Protocol</h1>
					<br>
					<p>With the aim of promoting a safe, inclusive and open space at ICLC 2025, the organizing team
						proposes a code of conduct that continues the spirit of previous live coding conferences. We
						invite all attendees and members of the broader community to work for a respectful and positive
						environment. As organizers we work hard to preserve the warm and open atmosphere of past events,
						and we believe that the responsibility to maintain a safe and welcoming environment is shared by
						the entire community.</p>

					<p>As participants, please be mindful of the effect your words and actions may have on others and
						that your boundaries may not be the same as those of others, based on their cultural,
						educational or personal experiences. If you act or speak in a way that someone finds
						inappropriate, that means it’s inappropriate in that context, regardless of your intent. If
						somebody tells you that you are making them uncomfortable, please respect their feedback and
						stop doing so immediately.</p>
					<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, age, sexual
							orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or
							technology choices.</li>


						<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.</li>
						<li>Discriminatory jokes or language.</li>
						<li>Disruption of talks, performances, or other events.</li>
						<li>Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual or suggestive remarks.</li>


						<li>Use of offensive imagery, language, or materials which others may find offensive, whether in
							person or online.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you are being harassed, witness harassment, or have any other concerns, please contact someone
						from TOPLAP Barcelona and ICLC organizers core team immediately. They will be wearing a red ICLC
						t-shirt. </p>

					<p>If you report an incident of harassment, you can expect to be listened to and taken seriously.
						The admin will take action they deem appropriate in response depending on the scale and severity
						of the incident. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Discuss the perpetrator’s behaviour with them and ask them to stop. Explain what they have
							done and why it is unacceptable. Remind the perpetrator of the code of conduct. Monitor the
							perpetrator’s behaviour and if it improves then they will continue to be welcome.</li>
						<li>Temporarily exclude the perpetrator from the event for a cool-off period. Explain what they
							have done and why it is unacceptable, and remind them of the code of conduct. Monitor the
							person’s behaviour and if it improves then they will continue to be welcome.</li>
						<li>Remove the perpetrator from the event. Explain what they have done and why it is
							unacceptable, and remind them of the code of conduct.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This applies to all events and venues of the conference whether they be talks, performances,
						late-night events, at the bar, or through online media.</p>

					<p>If you have any concerns please find a member of the organizing team (they'll be clearly
						identifiable during the conference) and let them know, or otherwise send an email to
						iclc@toplap.cat. </p>

					<p>Emergencies
						Telephone 112: this is the emergency telephone number, as in the rest of the European Union. In
						Barcelona, calls are dealt with in Catalan, Spanish, English and French and there is a
						translation service in other languages. The number is used to contact the Catalan Police. de
						Cataluña (Mossos d'Esquadra), fire brigade and ambulance service.</p>
					<p>This document is based on the following code of conducts: </p>
