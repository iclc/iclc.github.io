<h3 id="about"><strong>Intro</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) is dedicated to
        practices and research focused on technologies and philosophies that
        interpret the use of computer code and the public writing of algorithms
        as performative gestures. In its previous editions the community has
        provided valuable insights on this practice from diverse perspectives,
        including artistic, technical, artistic, philosophical, educational,
        social and political.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has been <strong>ten years</strong> since the first ICLC call for
        participation, which proposed
        <i
          >“[…] exploring liveness in symbolic abstractions, and understanding
          the perceptual, creative, productive, philosophical and cultural
          consequences.”</i
        >
        In the subsequent decade, we have collectively and collaboratively
        experimented with varying levels of live coding abstraction, developed
        domain-specific languages, and explored the levels of agency offered by
        models created manually, or sometimes with the assistance of learning
        algorithms. We have invented and played with numerous interfaces to
        interact with algorithms and the world around us during performances.
        These explorations revolve around defining what processes we actually
        want to showcase, and in which formats we want to express them, while
        “thinking algorithmically” with an audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this, the 9th edition of the conference, we invite the community to
        reflect about <strong><em>liveness</em></strong> and its many forms and
        consequences within live coding. We believe the tension between what is
        live and what is not is a key element of live coding. What effects does
        it have on the processes, technologies and forms in the performance? How
        do the many forms of liveness impact and transform the hybridization
        between the digital/algorithmic and the material? How does liveness
        relate to and/or define the socio-cultural aspects of live coding
        communities?
      </p>

      <h2 id="call-for-participation">
        <strong>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION</strong>
      </h2>

      <p>
        The 9th edition of ICLC will take place in <strong>Barcelona</strong>,
        Spain, from <strong>May 27 to May 31, 2025.</strong> We invite
        submissions in the form of papers, live performances, workshops and
        satellite events. The call is open to anyone engaged with live coding
        and its community principles.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are no submission fees. Submissions must be submitted in English.
        However, for the live performance category only, you are welcome to also
        submit the proposal in your native (or any) language and include a
        machine translated version. In this case, state on your submission that
        it was machine translated. Please review the information about
        submissions and important dates below.
      </p>

      <p>
        The proceedings of the conference will be published with a DOI number
        for each article.
      </p>

      <p>
        We invite you to send proposals related to this year’s theme,
        <strong><em>liveness</em></strong
        >, as highlighted by any of the following or even some other topic:
      </p>

      <h4 id="iclc-satellite-events"><strong>ICLC Satellite Events</strong></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Format: Declaration of interest</li>
        <li>
          Submit via email to
          <a href="mailto:iclc@toplap.cat">iclc@toplap.cat</a> until January 1st
          2025.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We invite live coding nodes from all over the world to host their own
        satellite events prior or after ICLC 2025. In particular we want to
        encourage other communities to create opportunities for traveling
        artists to perform or do a workshop in multiple locations (or on the way
        from/to Barcelona) and to turn ICLC 2025 into a tour – with Barcelona at
        its peak. While the committee of the ICLC cannot directly help with
        funding or organization of your event, an effort will be made to
        coordinate dates, locations and potential artists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please submit your intent to participate with your own event, providing
        us with a principal contact to your group/organization, the city where
        the event will take place and any information that might already be
        definitive (set date, set venue, line-up…). Additionally we invite you
        to join the channel <b>#iclc-satellite-events</b> on the
        <a href="https://discord.com/invite/D4Enr5u7Rp"
          >TOPLAP Discord server</a
        >
        to present and discuss your ideas for a satellite event in order to
        connect organizers as early as possible to make the most out of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We ask you to investigate possibilities to apply for local funding to
        help cover for accommodations, travel costs and in the best case artist
        fees. We can provide you with a <i>Letter of Intent</i> to support
        applications for funding, and will publish the date and URL of your
        event on the ICLC website.
      </p>

      
            
      <h1 id="environmental-statement">
        <strong>ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENT</strong>
      </h1>

      <p>
        We invite everyone to reflect on the impact that our research and
        practice has on our environment and ecosystems. Acknowledging this, we
        are incorporating sustainability and conservation criteria as guidelines
        for the conference planning. We invite everyone to take this into
        consideration before and after the conference. In the spirit of coming
        together for a live event, we want to encourage in-person attendance,
        and also encourage that attendees joining us make choices to minimize
        the impact of their travel with low-carbon options whenever possible. We
        also commit to fostering connections among attendees and nearby
        satellite events, to make the most of long distance travel with
        opportunities to turn your visit into a mini-tour. The presentations and
        performances of the conference will be live-streamed whenever possible.
        We are also open to hosting remote presentations when this is the best
        option.
