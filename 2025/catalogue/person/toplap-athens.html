within the Music Technology Group (MTG) and contributes as a member of the Freesound
project. Her research is centered on the tasks of characterizing and retrieving audio from large
and diverse sound collections. With a strong foundation in musicology, she brings a humanistic
perspective to the technological advancements emerging from her research by considering their
practical applications for users and their impact on artistic expression. Beyond her academic
pursuits, she is an artist (aka allholy) who continues to create music and actively engages with
artistic communities. She is a practitioner of live coding and currently participates in TOPLAP
Athens and TOPLAP Barcelona communities.</p>
