            <h2>About the Conference</h2>
            <p>Live coding refers to the creation and modification of algorithms with a creative purpose in real time often in the presence of a physical or virtual audience.
              The community is diverse and seeks to engage in a wide cross-section of artistic practices including but not limited to music, audiovisual creation, performance,
              robotics, dance, scientific research and education.</p>
            <p>Live coding is primarily developed inside the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement">free culture movement</a>, and encourages self creativity rather than cultural consumption.
              Also diversity inclusion and respect has always been considered a fundamental part of the thinking around this practice in live coding communities.
              For more information on live coding, please refer to the <a href="https://toplap.org/">TOPLAP</a> website and to previous
              <a href="http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/">editions of these conferences</a>.</p>
              <p>The fourth International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC) will take place between the 16th and 18th of January 2019 and will be hosted by
              <a href="https://www.medialab-prado.es/">Medialab-Prado</a> and other neighbouring institutions and cultural agents of Madrid.
              The conference  will consist of presentations, performances, concerts, workshops and other activities grounded in the field of live coding with the aim
              of exploring the richness and diversity of the practice driven by the creative power of its international community which include

          <h2>Place</h2>
          <p>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WfG7CVFKiQ&t=94s">Madrid is fun</a>”... said our ex-mayor in her attempt to host the olympic games for 2020. Indeed! Madrid offers
            great places to relax, enjoy traditional gastronomy and party as well as being a unique space for culture, sharing and collaborative learning.</p>
          <p>The airport Adolfo Suárez-Madrid Barajas (MAD) is the main gateway to the city. It has three active Terminals: T1, T2 and T4 (with a small satellite T4s).
            Depending on what Terminal visitors arrives to/leaves from, there are several options to get from/to the airport to/from the city:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Taxi service reaches every Terminal and costs between 20€ to 30€ according to the <a href="http://www.aeropuertomadrid-barajas.com/transportation/madrid-airport-bytaxi.htm">information published on the airport</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/en/airport-express?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.es%2F">Bus (Airport Express)</a>. This service works 24/7. It takes 40 minutes
              approximately to reach the airport (T1, T2, T4) from city center. It costs 5€ and runs every 15 min. during the day and 35 min. at night. There are only a few stops where a
              visitor can take this bus.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.aena.es/en/madrid-barajas-airport/underground.html">Metro</a>. Accesible desde T2 y T4, tarda una hora aproximadamente en llegar al centro de Madrid.
              It is accessible from T2 and T4, it takes around one hour to get to city center. There is a compulsory complementary ticket of 3€ that must be paid to use subway on the airport.
               We don’t recommend Metro to go to the airport if you are in a rush although, on the other hand, visitors can take the subway from many stations in the city.
               In order to use metro network in Madrid, visitors must purchase a multipersonal card, that must be filled with 10 travels. There is also a <a href="https://www.metromadrid.es/en/viaja_en_metro/Tarifasybilletes/abonos/contenido02.html">Turist card</a> valid for several days.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.aeropuertomadrid-barajas.com/transportation/madrid-airport-bytrain.htm">Train (Renfe).</a> Is only available from/to T4. It costs 2.60€ and takes 25 minutes to get to city center. We highly recommend this way if visitors are lucky to travel from/to T4. Once at T4 visitors
              could use a <a href="http://www.aena.es/en/madrid-barajas-airport/transport-between-terminals.html">bus between terminals</a> that takes around 15 min. to travel through the
              terminals. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>To access Medialab Prado, the best option is to address to Estación del Arte (or Atocha Renfe) station. All transportations listed above (Metro, Renfe, or Bus Airport Express or Taxi) reach there from the Airport. </p>
          <p>Madrid offers a vast choice of Hostels, Hotels, and B&Bs which are published in the most notorious hotel booking websites.</p>

           <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>With the aim of promoting a safe, inclusive and open space at ICLC 2019, the organizing team propose a code of conduct in continuity with the prior conferences on live coding. We invite everyone attending the conference and the communities around it to work for a respectful and positive environment. As organizers we work hard to preserve the warm and open atmosphere that characterize pasts live coding conferences.</p>
            <p>As participants, please be mindful of the effect your words and actions may have on others and that your boundaries may not be the same as the boundaries of others for either cultural, education or personal reasons. If you act or speak in a way that someone finds inappropriate, it’s inappropriate to that time, place and/or person. If somebody tells you that you are making them uncomfortable, please stop doing so.</p>
              <p>Harassment, and other exclusionary behaviour are not welcome at the conference. Harassment includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>offensive verbal comments or attitudes related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion;</li>
                <li>deliberate intimidation, stalking or following</li>
                <li>discriminatory jokes and language;</li>
                <li>sustained disruption of events, talks or performances;</li>
                <li>inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or suggestive remarks;</li>
                <li>inappropriate use of imagery or other material which others may find offensive.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>This applies to all events and venues of the conference whether they be talks, performances, late-night events, at the bar, or through Facebook or Twitter or other online media.</p>

                <p>If you have any concerns please find a member of the organising team (they'll be clearly identifiable during the conference) and let them know, or otherwise send us an email to: iclc2019 at livecodemad dot org.
